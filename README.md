# Smart-Energy-Consumption-Analysis-and-Prediction-using-Machine-Learning-with-Device-Level-Insights
This project is about understanding how much electricity different appliances in a smart home use. Instead of only seeing one total electricity bill at the end of the month, we want to see which device uses how much power and when. This will help us know where energy is being wasted.
